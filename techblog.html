		<p> <div class="teacher"> Alan: </div> <div class="answers"> 50 years old. </div> </p>

	</div>

	<div class="QandA">
		<p> <div class="student"> Student: </div> <div class="questions"> How has tecnology changed over your lifetime? </div> </p>
		<p> <div class="teacher"> Alan: </div> <div class="answers"> We got a TV when I was 4 years old. The TVs in my house had no dial, you would pick up and an operator would come up. You also had to share phone lines with your neighbors. There was always a fight to use the phone and TVs with color didn't come until 10 years later. TV would go off air at 10pm and come back on at 6am. There were no computers or cellphones. </div> </p>

	<div class="QandA">
		<p> <div class="student"> Student: </div> <div class="questions"> Have the changes you've seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society? </div> </p>
		<p> <div class="teacher"> Alan: </div> <div class="answers"> It's a mixed bag. On one having a phone makes you feel safer being alone. On the other hand it allows ppl to do a mediocre job. You can use photoshop and be okay, but does that make you a visual artist? it makes a bad job okay. </div> </p>

	<div class="QandA"> 
		<p> <div class="student"> Student: </div>  <div class="questions"> What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology? </div>  </p>
